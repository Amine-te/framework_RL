# Reinforcement Learning Framework

A flexible and extensible **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** framework built around a customizable **GridWorld** environment.  
This project provides an experimental playground for developing, testing, and comparing a wide range of RL algorithms in controlled scenarios.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This framework aims to make it easy to:
- Design and visualize **grid-based environments** with configurable layouts, rewards, and dynamics.
- Implement and experiment with **different RL agents** — from classic tabular methods to modern function approximations.
- Compare agent performance across **varied test setups** and visualize their learning behavior using plots, metrics, and GIFs.

It is still **under active development**, with many components and improvements yet to come.
